With the rapid advancement in technology, intelligent systems are introduced every day, making processes more sophisticated and efficient. There is an increasing demand for cutting-edge technology and smart systems in various fields, including agriculture. Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting crop yields, allowing farmers and agronomists to make data-driven decisions to optimize their practices and improve productivity. 
Crop yield prediction using Machine Learning leverages vast amounts of historical and real-time data to forecast agricultural output. This includes data on weather patterns, soil conditions, crop types, and farming practices.
The aim of this project is used to find the production according to different types of crop in an area according to season.
